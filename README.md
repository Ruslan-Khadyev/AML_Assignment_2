# AML_Assignment_2
Developed by Ruslan Khadyev

In this assignment we will solve tasks using generative models. Assignment consists of 2 main tasks.

### Anomaly detection in the domain of finance
In the domain of finance data has a lot of missing values. For this part we need to do the folowing:
1) Fill missing values using generative models (Autoencoders).
2) Measure the perfomence of autoencoder approach perfomence and compare with statistical approaches.
3) Reduce the dimenssion of the data using Principal component analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis and compare the impact on selected machine learning model.

### Anomaly detection in the domain of cyber security
The task about anomaly detection in the domain of cyber security. The anomalies are in the form of network intrusions. For this part we need to do the folowing:
1) Detect network intrusions
2) Measure the quality of data generated by a generative adversarial model.

For each task we have individual data. You can download it for [Task1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVl4Q4Bq3Fbwv60lLthfBc6eYxYLrdnU/view) and [Task 2](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2FUNSW-NB15%20-%20CSV%20Files%2Fa%20part%20of%20training%20and%20testing%20set)

# Run the project

1) To run this project clone it first on your computer to the specific folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RusMarshall/AML_Assignment_2
```
or download ```.zip``` file

2) Open or download IDE like "pyCharm" after go to ```File -> open -> SSD-Assignment-1``` folder

3) Setup interpreter for python environment if it was not set

4) install all necessary libs in ```requirements.txt``` file

Then, choose which part of the project you want to run of the First task:

Task_1, subtask_1 -> use ```Autoencoders_train_test.py``` 

Task_1, subtask_2 -> use ```Comparison_with_statistics.py```

Task_1, subtask_3 -> use ```Dimensions_reduction.py``` 

For Task_1 it is necessary to add arguments after script name like: ```python Autoencoders_train_test.py path_to_identity_csvm path_to_transaction_csv``` for each of subtasks.

For Task 2 start files are:

Task_2, subtask_1 -> use ```cgan_train.py``` 

Task_2, subtask_2 -> use ```cgan_test.py```
